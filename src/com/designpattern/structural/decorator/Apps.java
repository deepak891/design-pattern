/**
 * Important design principle : Class should be open for extension but close for modification
 *
 * For example : In observer pattern we can add new Observer + extend subject without adding code to subject
 *
 * - out goal is to allow classes to easily extended with new behaviour without modifying existing code.
 * - it is good! flexible if requirement is changing we don't have to rewrite whole application.
 *
 * -------------------------------------------
 * Decorator pattern : Attaches additional responsibility to an object dynamically!!!
